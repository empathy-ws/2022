											<h2>Overview</h2>

											<p>In the last decade, the spreading of low-cost technologies integrating sensors and 
												actuators has favored the development of the so-called smart objects. This trend has 
												been further fostered by the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects the physical 
												world with the Internet via ubiquitous sensors and actuators.</br>
												The opportunities offered by the IoT are amplified by the use of new approaches 
												that, based on novel interaction paradigms, involve directly non-technical users in 
												configuring the joint behavior of their smart objects, among them and with online 
												services. Existing solutions to define the behavior of such “IoT ecosystems” range 
												from systems that leave the users complete control for establishing the joint behavior 
												of smart objects, to solutions that automatically define smart objects behavior exploiting intelligent techniques. In this continuum, different technologies, frameworks, and 
												approaches present different levels of user control and automation. In this perspective,
												it is also important to consider the emerging role played by social and humanoid robots, which are integrated sets of sensors and actuators with human-like behaviors.
												Given the diffusion and the relevance that these approaches have been gaining, this 
												workshop aims to serve as a venue for discussing ongoing research and sharing ideas 
												for researchers and practitioners working on solutions to personalize the behavior of 
												IoT ecosystems.</p>

													participation in order to have stimulating discussion from various
													perspectives. Topics include, but are not limited, to:
														<ul>
															<li>
																End-User Development (EUD) for IoT;
															</li>
															<li>
																Interaction Paradigms for IoT;
															</li>
															<li>
																Usability of IoT Systems;	
															</li>
															<li>
																Interface Design for IoT; 	
															</li>
															<li>
																Intelligent Interface for IoT Systems;
															</li>
															<li>
																Accessibility for IoT Systems;
															</li>
															<li>
																Virtual and Augmented Reality for EUD in IoT settings;
															</li>
															<li>
																Conversational User Interfaces for EUD;
															</li>
															<li>
																Usable Privacy and Security in IoT systems;
															</li>
															<li>
																Personalisation and Recommendations for IoT;
															</li>
														</ul>

											<h2>Submissions</h2>

											<p> We invite submissions of two types: short papers (3-4 pages) and
												position papers (1-2 pages). Participants are asked to submit their
												paper describing their recent or future work in one of the areas
												indicated in the topics of interest. All submissions must be in the
												CHI Extended Abstracts format (<a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/</a>).
												<br>Papers should be submitted in PDF to easychair
												(<a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=empathy2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=empathy2022</a>). All papers will
												be reviewed by the organizers and by the program committee based on
												relevance and significance in order to provide constructive comments to
												the submitters. Reviewing will be single blind (i.e. author names and
												affiliations should be listed). If accepted, at least one of the authors
												must register and attend the workshop. 
												<br>Final versions of the accepted papers will be published in the <b>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</b> (<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/" target="_blank">http://ceur-ws.org/</a>), indexed by Scopus.

												<b>Bernardo Breve</b> is a Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Salerno. His research interests include artificial intelligence, 
												data science, and Human-Computer Interaction, with emphasis on usable security and privacy for end-users. He has been a member of the program committee of the 
												International DMS Conference on Visualization and Visual Languages since 2020, where he served as Publicity co-chair and Program co-chair in 2021 and 2022, 
												respectively. He also serves as a reviewer for international journals, such as Multimedia Tools and Applications (MTAP), and ACM Transactions on the Web (TWeb).

												Rizvi’s research focuses on the design of interdisciplinary tools and platforms for citizens and domain-experts. Such tools often
												either follow the no-code/low-code paradigm, or tangible interaction, or are in the form of conversational agents, making the interaction by end-users easier.  
												Outcomes of his work have been published in various international research journals and conference proceedings, and also have been exhibited to general public 
												in interactive art exhibitions.
